# Dot Files
setup all dotfiles in your user directory.

## To Use
I don't suggest you go using these files without understanding what they do. But if you must, the files get symlinked into position in your home directory from this directory. Their filenames should remain the same. I highly suggest that if you're going to use pieces of this, that you fork this repo into your own Github account, at the very least. Then remove what you don't want.

## TODO
* Update gitconfig
* Update bashrc
* .editorconfig
* .npmrc
* update readme
* License
