# Dot Files
setup all dotfiles in your user home directory.

## To Use
I don't suggest you go using these files without understanding what they do. But if you must, the files get symlinked into position in your home directory from this directory. Their filenames should remain the same. I highly suggest that if you're going to use pieces of this, that you fork this repo into your own Github account, at the very least. Then remove what you don't want.

1. Fork project.
2. Clone into your home directory
3. Edit however you want this to be
4. Run bootstrap.sh

## TODO
* Add .npmrc?
* update readme
